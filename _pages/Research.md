## Working Papers

<!-- [Approximating demand dynamics in storable good industries](../assets/workingpapers/CrawfordAR (2020) Approximating Demand Dyanmics for Storable goods.pdf) -->

This paper develops a new approach that combines firm margins, market-level industry data and a static demand model to construct sets containing unbiased estimates of long-run price elasticities for storable good industries. It obviates the need to solve the consumer's value function and can be completed within policy-making timeframe. This methodology allows for the effect of contemporaneous and inter-temporal substitution on pricing incentives to be measured by dynamic diversion ratios. Together with the margins, these are key inputs into a new price pressure test for unilateral effects arising from mergers in industries with dynamic demand. This framework is applied to the UK laundry detergent industry from 2002 to 2012. I conduct two policy experiments that show how estimated sets of bias-corrected price elasticities and diversion ratios avoid misguided policy-decisions. The first experiment uses the newly developed price pressure test to examine a hypothetical brand acquisition. The other assesses whether there is any evidence that anti-competitive conduct of a laundry detergent cartel in mainland Europe had any effect in the UK. Both experiments demonstrate the efficacy of set-valued policy tools.

#### High-dimensional inventories and consumer dynamics: demand estimation for fast moving consumer goods 

_New version coming soon_

<!--**[High-dimensional inventories and consumer dynamics: demand estimation for fast moving consumer goods](../assets/workingpapers/AlanCrawfordJMP.pdf)**-->

This paper develops a high-dimensional dynamic discrete-continuous demand model for storable fast moving consumer goods. Assumptions of existing models are relaxed while retaining computational tractability. As a result, the model captures rich inter- and intra-temporal substitution patterns, allows for a detailed understanding of dynamic consumer behaviour, and provides a framework with wide applicability. To estimate and solve the dynamic demand model, I use techniques from approximate dynamic programming, large-scale dynamic programming in economics, machine learning, and statistical computing. In this paper I apply the model to the UK laundry detergent sector using household level purchase data.
