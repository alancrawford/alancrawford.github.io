#### High-dimensional inventories and consumer dynamics: demand estimation for fast moving consumer goods [new version soon]

<!--**[High-dimensional inventories and consumer dynamics: demand estimation for fast moving consumer goods](../assets/workingpapers/AlanCrawfordJMP.pdf)**-->

This paper develops a high-dimensional dynamic discrete-continuous demand model for storable fast moving consumer goods. Assumptions of existing models are relaxed while retaining computational tractability. As a result, the model captures rich inter- and intra-temporal substitution patterns, allows for a detailed understanding of dynamic consumer behaviour, and provides a framework with wide applicability. To estimate and solve the dynamic demand model, I use techniques from approximate dynamic programming, large-scale dynamic programming in economics, machine learning, and statistical computing. In this paper I apply the model to the UK laundry detergent sector using household level purchase data.

#### Approximating demand dynamics in antitrust policy [new version soon]

<!--**[Approximating demand dynamics in antitrust policy](../assets/workingpapers/Crawford_AppxDemandDynamics.pdf)**-->

Empirical analysis for antitrust policy commonly uses accounting margins as inputs into merger screening tools. This paper shows how these margins can be combined with a static demand model to estimate a set of price elasticities for storable goods that are consistent with dynamic demand responses to permanent, rather than transitory price changes. As a result, demand dynamics that create inter-temporal substitution for storable goods are better captured by the resulting set of price elasticities. To illustrate this method, I apply it to the UK laundry detergent industry from 2002 to 2012. I present evidence that product innovations in this industry that lower storage costs affect demand dynamics and hence the degree of bias of price elasticities that come from static demand models. I also show how adjusting price elasticities to reflect demand dynamics can lead to different policy conclusions. I illustrate this by assessing whether there is any evidence that anti-competitive conduct of a laundry detergent cartel in mainland Europe had any effect on the UK laundry detergent market.
