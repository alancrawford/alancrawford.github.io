<p>This paper develops a new approach that combines firm margins,
market-level industry data and a static demand model to construct sets
containing unbiased estimates of long-run price elasticities for storable
goods. It obviates the need to solve the consumer‚Äôs value function and can
be completed within a policy-makers timeframe. This methodology allows
for the effect of contemporaneous and inter-temporal substitution on
pricing incentives to be measured by dynamic diversion ratios. Together
with the margins, these are key inputs into a new price pressure test for
unilateral effects arising from mergers in industries with dynamic demand.
This framework is applied to the UK laundry detergent industry from 2002
to 2012. I conduct two policy experiments that show how estimated sets of
bias-corrected price elasticities and diversion ratios can be used to avoid
misguided policy decisions. In both cases demonstrating the efficacy of
set-valued policy tools.</p>

<!--**[High-dimensional inventories and consumer dynamics: demand estimation for fast moving consumer goods](../assets/workingpapers/AlanCrawfordJMP.pdf)**-->

<p>This paper develops a high-dimensional dynamic discrete-continuous demand model for storable fast moving consumer goods. Assumptions of existing models are relaxed while retaining computational tractability. As a result, the model captures rich inter- and intra-temporal substitution patterns, allows for a detailed understanding of dynamic consumer behaviour, and provides a framework with wide applicability. To estimate and solve the dynamic demand model, I use techniques from approximate dynamic programming, large-scale dynamic programming in economics, machine learning, and statistical computing. In this paper I apply the model to the UK laundry detergent sector using household level purchase data.</p>
