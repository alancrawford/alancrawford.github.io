## Working Papers

### **[Dynamic Demand for Storable Goods]()**

This paper develops a dynamic discrete-continuous demand model for storable goods - a class of goods that account for a large fraction of grocery expenditures. To estimate and solve the dynamic demand model, we use techniques from: (i) Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), (ii) large scale dynamic programming in economics, (iii) machine learning, and (iv) statistical computing. The benefits of this approach are three-fold. First, the dynamic demand model is compatible high-dimensional choice sets. Second, it can capture rich inter- and intra-temporal substitution patterns. Third, the dimension reduction strategies do not rely on the idiosyncratic features of the industry being studied. As a result, it can be estimated for any storable good industry. In this paper we apply the model to the UK laundry detergent sector using household level purchase data.
